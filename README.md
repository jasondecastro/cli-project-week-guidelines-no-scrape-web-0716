In order to use the great Zoltar fortune teller, you need to follow two simple steps.

1. Run `ruby bin/rb`
2. Answer the questions.

You need to be an active, die-hard member of The 404s (Flatiron School's Web Immersive Summer 2016 Batch) if you want Zoltar to tell you your fortune and other creepy information.
